Release 0.3.1 (2008-04-27)
==========================

gtkmm-utils
-----------

 - TileView: new function - reset_selection()

glibmm-utils
------------

 - Cleaned up wording in logging messages (Jonathon Jongsma)
 - Improved memory handling in split()
 - Added a version of split() which splits by any whitespace
 - trim(): don't fail on empty strings (J. Jongsma, bug #22518)

Release 0.3.0 (2007-11-03)
==========================

Common
------

All header files have been renamed to *.h, to match with most of
the C++ libraries, and especially gtkmm.

gtkmm-utils
-----------

Tile: Added added virtual signal handlers, signal_unselected(),
signal_focus_in(), signal_focus_out(). The latter two are emitted by
Tile, while the selected/unselected are now controlled by TileView,
and emitted after the selection has been changed between the packed Tiles.

There is an option in the constructor to make the contents of the Tile
left-aligned to the image.

TileView now avoids connecting to tiles' signals multiple times.
There's a fix for add_tile() pointer overload, to avoid infinite
loops (eek). It also overrides button press event and does not allow
the focus to escape outside itself with the up and down keys.
And a convenient clear() method has been added.

The Dialog namespace has been removed and the corresponding functions
renamed to dialog_*. There are no additional namespaces any more.

glibmm-utils
------------

Added trim* string, uprintf() functions. The logging environment
variable is now shortened to LOG_DOMAINS (bug #21360 - Jonathon Jongsma).


Release 0.2.1 (2007-09-27)
==========================

Build scripts
-------------

Removed the -release flag from LDFLAGS for both glibmm-utils
and gtkmm-utils. With this flag, releases would never be binary
compatible with each other because each release would have a
different soname.

Link gtkmm-utils properly against glibmm-utils .la file in the
top build directory. When building from a clean install (e.g.
creating a Debian package), the build failed for gtkmm-utils
due to undefined references to Gtk::Util::uprintf().

Jonathon Jongsma spotted both of these problems and provided
fixes for them.

Release 0.2.0 (2007-09-27)
==========================

New Tile API
------------

Tiles are intuitive widgets for a better user experience, by default composed
of an image, highlighted title and a short description. They offer important
extensibility not available when building a GtkTreeView-based interface.
Very similar UI components are currently used by the Beagle search
tool (http://beagle-project.org). This release introduces the Tile widget,
TileView, a container, and optional PageNavigator, which can together provide
an integrated page-separated view. An example is provided.

Logging
-------

The logging framework is now optionally thread-aware, which means that calling
Initializer::do_init() (ie initializing Glib threading) is not obligatory
any more (bug #21008, Jonathon Jongsma).

Minor API additions
-------------------

uprintf(), a printf for Glib::ustring.

Documentation
-------------

The Doxygen documentation has been updated to cover the tile API, while the
existing has been corrected where necessary.

Build scripts
-------------

The API version is now hardcoded to 1.0. It is does not mean that it is stable,
but rather an important clarification: the (target) API version is 1.0, while
the releases are currently 0.x. This also means that from now on the headers
will be installed in $prefix/include/gtkmm-utils-1.0/gtkmm-utils/.

The option to build with GCC visibility support, which has been present in 0.1
but not used effectively, is for now removed (commented) due to significant
problems it may cause when compiling. There is a separate branch 'visibility'
in the repository where work related to this is kept.

Release 0.1.0 (2007-08-26)
==========================

Imported the logging framework originally written by Dodji Seketeli, available
in Nemiver (http://home.gna.org/nemiver). Together with some date, option
parsing, string and dialog utility function, it made the first release.
